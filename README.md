Soliloquy Background
============

Allows Soliloquy Slider images to be output as the background of the element instead of an image.  This allows you to use images larger than the typical viewport as part of your slider.

This plugin is Bring Your Own CSS.  Since Soliloquy typically resizes based upon your image sizes, you will have to set your own heights in the CSS For the containers and list items in Soliloquy.
